> Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. [Josh Wills](https://twitter.com/josh_wills/status/198093512149958656?s=20)

The Darkside of that quote is real!  Data scientists don't program as well as software engineers.  Data scientists are also reasonably soft when it comes to understanding the larger field of statistical analysis. We can improve over time. However, our domain structure often demands that we don't specialize in the technical areas as we are often scaling up in other domains. If we did specialize, then we would be called statisticians or software engineers.

> It is no exaggeration to say that git (and other forms of version control software) underlie the entire world of open source software, and are central to the operation of nearly every tech company on the planet. ... OK, now the bad news: learning git kinda sucks. I mean, it’s not painful like performing an appendectomy on yourself without anesthesia, and it’s not hard like quantum mechanics or geometric topology; it’s definitely something anyone can learn.
